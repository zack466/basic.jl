- take advantage of julia type system and multiple dispatch
- use macros to generate recursive descent parsers, or try to use parser combinators
- look at other BASICs, such as GW-BASIC, FreeBASIC, Vintage BASIC, etc for reference
- allow for modular grammar / different syntaxes, possible bc julia jit compiled
 - the grammar can be written inside julia itself using macros/operators
- lazy parsing, next() and peek() instead of eagerly gathering all tokens
- use views, which may be faster than slicing arrays (which makes a copy)
- allow for graphical output, simulate using ncurses

stages
1 - parses the tokens recursively, generates julia ASTs which can be evaluated using `eval` (done - basic1.jl)
2 - creates an AST in julia using structs/types, evaluate methods dispatched on node type
3 - use the AST to generate bytecode for a vm (stack machine)
